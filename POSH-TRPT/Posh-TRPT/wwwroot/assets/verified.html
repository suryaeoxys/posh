<center><b>Last Updated: May 10th, 2024</b></p></center>

<p>These Terms of Service constitute a legally binding agreement (the &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;) between you and Posh, Inc., its parents, subsidiaries, representatives, affiliates, officers and directors (collectively, &ldquo;Posh,&rdquo; &ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;us&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo;) governing your use of the Posh applications, websites, technology, facilities, and platform (collectively, the &ldquo;Posh Platform&rdquo;).</p>

<p>PLEASE BE ADVISED: THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS PROVISIONS THAT GOVERN HOW CLAIMS BETWEEN YOU AND Posh CAN BE BROUGHT (SEE SECTION 17 BELOW). THESE PROVISIONS WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION, REQUIRE YOU TO: (1) WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, AND (2) SUBMIT CLAIMS YOU HAVE AGAINST Posh TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS, GROUP OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. AS A DRIVER OR DRIVER APPLICANT, YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN CLAIMS AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 17.</p>

<p>By entering into this Agreement, and/or by using or accessing the Posh Platform, you expressly acknowledge that you understand this Agreement (including the dispute resolution and arbitration provisions in Section 17) and accept all of its terms. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU MAY NOT USE OR ACCESS THE Posh PLATFORM OR ANY OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED THROUGH THE Posh PLATFORM. If you use the Posh Platform in another country, you agree to be subject to Posh&rsquo;s terms of service for that country. If you are accessing or using the Posh Platform to access or use Posh Business services on behalf of an organization contracted with Posh, and you are not accessing or using the Posh Platform as a Rider or Driver, your access and use is governed by the contract between Posh and your organization.</p>

<p>When using the Posh Platform, you also agree to conduct yourself in accordance with our Community Guidelines, which shall form part of this Agreement between you and Posh.</p>

<p>The Posh Platform<br>
The Posh Platform provides a marketplace where, among other things, persons who seek transportation to certain destinations (&ldquo;Riders&rdquo;) can be matched with transportation options to such destinations. One option for Riders is to request a ride from rideshare drivers who are driving to or through those destinations (&ldquo;Drivers&rdquo;). Drivers, Riders, and any other individuals, excluding any Excluded Individuals, using the Posh Platform are collectively referred to herein as &ldquo;Users,&rdquo; and the driving services provided by Drivers to Riders, and other transportation related services provided by Drivers in connection with the Posh Platform, shall be referred to herein as &ldquo;Rideshare Services.&rdquo; &ldquo;Posh Services&rdquo; shall include any service provided by Posh pursuant to the Posh Platform (for clarity, Posh Services does not include Rideshare Services or Third-Party Services). As a User, you authorize Posh to match and/or re-match you with Drivers or Riders based on factors such as your location, the requested pickup location, the estimated time to pick up, your destination, User preferences, ride mode, driver mode, membership status, regulatory or other third-party requirements, user statistics, and platform efficiency, and to cancel an existing match based on the same or other considerations. Any decision by a User to offer or accept Rideshare Services is a decision made in such User&rsquo;s sole discretion. A separate agreement is formed between Drivers and Riders when the Rider accepts the Rideshare Services offered by the Driver. As used herein, &ldquo;Excluded Individuals&rdquo; means any individual who is registering to use the Posh Platform or whose use of the Posh Platform is on behalf of an organization contracted with Posh, except as a Rider or Driver.</p>

<p>In certain markets, Riders may have the option to rent transportation modalities (e.g., bikes, scooters, cars, etc.) or be offered other services through the Posh Platform. In some markets, some of these rental programs and/or other services are owned and operated by Posh. In other markets, some of these rental programs and/or other services are owned or operated by third parties.</p>

<p>In any case, your use of Posh Services through the Posh Platform may be subject to additional agreements between you and Posh as applicable to the particular service in the particular market (&ldquo;Supplemental Agreements&rdquo;). Please review any applicable Supplemental Agreements carefully. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF A SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENT, YOU MAY NOT RENT OR USE Posh SERVICES IN SUCH MARKET. In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any Supplemental Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control, unless such Supplemental Agreement specifically states otherwise.</p>

<p>Modification to the Agreement<br>
Posh reserves the right to modify the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and such modifications shall be binding on you only upon your acceptance of the modified Agreement. Posh reserves the right to modify any information on pages referenced in the hyperlinks from this Agreement from time to time, and such modifications shall become effective upon posting. Continued use of the Posh Platform after any such changes shall constitute your acceptance of such changes. Unless material changes are made to the arbitration provisions herein, you agree that modification of this Agreement does not create a renewed opportunity to opt out of arbitration (if applicable).</p>

<p>Eligibility<br>
The Posh Platform may only be used by individuals who have the right and authority to enter into this Agreement and are fully able and competent to satisfy the terms, conditions, and obligations herein. The Posh Platform is not available to Users who have had their User account temporarily or permanently deactivated. You may not allow other persons to use your User account, you agree that you are the sole authorized user of your User account, and you may not use your User account on behalf of any third party, except as otherwise expressly permitted by Posh. To use the Posh Platform, each User shall create a User account. Each person may only create one User account, and Posh reserves the right to deactivate any additional or duplicate accounts. Your participation in certain Posh programs and use of certain Posh services may be subject to additional eligibility requirements as determined by Posh.</p>

<p>By becoming a User, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years old. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are the parent or legal guardian of a 16 or 17-year old minor you may create a User account for such minor to use the Posh Platform subject to the following requirements and restrictions: (a) you ensure that the minor&rsquo;s use of the Posh Platform is limited solely to accessing and using Posh Services and/or Third-Party Services where expressly permitted under the Supplemental Agreement applicable to such Posh Services and/or Third-Party Services, (b) you determine that the Posh Services and/or Third-Party Services are suitable for the minor, (c) you ensure that the minor&rsquo;s use of the Posh Platform and applicable Posh Services and/or Third-Party Services is done in compliance and acknowledgement of all applicable safety instructions and warnings in this Agreement, any applicable Supplemental Agreements, and the Posh Platform, (d) you ensure that the minor does not request or accept any Rideshare Services unless accompanied by you or an authorized guardian, and (e) you explain the terms of this Agreement to the minor. For clarity, no unaccompanied User under 18 years old may ride in an autonomous vehicle.</p>

<p>By creating a User account for such minor, you hereby give permission and consent to the Agreement on the minor&rsquo;s behalf, you expressly guarantee the minor&rsquo;s acceptance, and your own acceptance, of the terms of this Agreement, and you shall assume any and all responsibility and liability for the minor&rsquo;s use of the Posh Platform as provided by the terms of this Agreement and any applicable Supplemental Agreements. You will be responsible for any breach of the above representations, warranties and/or this Agreement, and/or any attempt of the minor to disaffirm this Agreement. Furthermore, you hereby represent that you are fully authorized to execute this Agreement on behalf of yourself and all other parents or legal guardians of the minor rider.</p>

<p>Charges<br>
As a User, you understand that request or use of Rideshare Services, Posh Services, or Third-Party Services may result in charges (&ldquo;Charges&rdquo;) to you and/or to an organization, if applicable. Charges to Riders and/or organizations, if applicable, for Rideshare Services include Fares (defined below) and other applicable fees, tolls, surcharges, and taxes, including as set forth on your market&rsquo;s Posh Cities page (&ldquo;Posh Cities Page&rdquo;), plus any tips to the Driver that you elect to pay. Posh has the authority and reserves the right to determine and modify pricing by posting applicable pricing terms to your market&rsquo;s Posh Cities Page or quoting you a price for a specific ride at the time you make a request. Pricing may vary based on the type of service you request (e.g., shared, economy, extra seats, luxury) as described on your market&rsquo;s Posh Cities Page or within the Posh Platform. You are responsible for reviewing the applicable Posh Cities Page or price quote within the Posh Platform and shall be responsible for all Charges incurred under your User account regardless of your awareness of such Charges or the amounts thereof.</p>

<p>Rideshare Service Fares (&ldquo;Fares&rdquo;). There are two types of Fares, quoted and variable.</p>

<p>Quoted Fares. When you make a ride request using the Posh Platform, Posh will quote you a Fare at the time of your request. The quote is subject to change until the ride request is confirmed. If your final destination is not the same as the destination in your ride request, or the time or distance of your ride differs substantially from your quoted fare, or if you attempt to abuse the Posh Platform, we may, at Posh&rsquo;s sole discretion and determination, cancel the fare quote and charge you a variable fare as described below. Posh does not guarantee that the quoted fare price will be equal to a variable fare for the same ride. Quoted fares may include the Rideshare Service Fees and Other Charges below, as applicable.<br>
Variable Fares. Variable fares consist of a base charge and incremental charges based on the time and distance of your ride. For particularly short rides, minimum fares may apply. Please note that we use GPS data from your Driver&rsquo;s phone to calculate the distance traveled on your ride. We cannot guarantee the availability or accuracy of GPS data. If we lose signal, we will calculate time and distance using available data from your ride. In addition to the variable fare, the total cost of your ride may include the Rideshare Service Fees and Other Charges below, as applicable.<br>
Rideshare Service Fees and Other Charges.</p>

<p>Service Fee. Posh may charge a &ldquo;Service Fee&rdquo; for each ride, as set forth on the applicable Posh Cities Page.<br>
Prime Time. At certain times, including times of high demand for Rideshare Services (&ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;), you acknowledge that Charges may increase substantially. For quoted fares, we may factor Prime Time increases into the quoted price of the ride.<br>
Priority Pickup and Wait &amp; Save. In some cases, you may be able to select an expected pick up that is faster or slower than standard for a higher or lower Fare, respectively.<br>
Cancellation Fee. After requesting a ride you may cancel it through the Posh Platform, but note that in certain cases a cancellation fee may apply. Posh may also charge a fee if you fail to show up after requesting a ride. Please check out our Help Center to learn more about Posh&rsquo;s rider cancellation policy.<br>
Damage Fee. If a Driver reports that you have materially damaged the Driver's vehicle, you agree to pay a &ldquo;Damage Fee&rdquo; of up to $250 depending on the extent of the damage (as determined by Posh in its sole discretion), towards vehicle repair or cleaning. Posh reserves the right (but is not obligated) to verify or otherwise require documentation of damages prior to processing the Damage Fee.<br>
Abuse Fee. If we receive a credible report that you have misused or abused the Posh Platform, you agree to pay an &ldquo;Abuse Fee&rdquo; of up to $250 as determined by Posh in its sole discretion. Posh reserves the right (but is not obligated) to verify or otherwise require documentation of abuse prior to processing the Abuse Fee.<br>
Tolls. In some instances, tolls, toll estimates, or return tolls may apply to your ride. Please see our Help Center and your market&rsquo;s Posh Cities Page for more information about toll charges. We do not guarantee that the amount charged by Posh will match the toll charged to the Driver, if any.<br>
Other Charges. Other fees and surcharges may apply to your ride, including, but not limited to: actual or anticipated airport fees, state fees, local fees, event fees, fuel surcharges, wait time fees, or distance surcharges as determined by Posh or its marketing partners. In addition, where required by law Posh will collect applicable taxes. See your market&rsquo;s Posh Cities Page for information on other Charges that may apply to your ride.<br>
Tips. Following a ride, you may have the opportunity to elect to tip your Driver in cash or through the Posh Platform. You may also elect to set a default tip amount or percentage through the Posh Platform. Any tips will be provided entirely to the applicable Driver.<br>
Charges Generally.</p>

<p>Facilitation of Charges. All Charges are facilitated through a third-party payment processor (First Data, Stripe, Inc., Braintree, a division of PayPal, Inc., etc.). Posh may replace its third-party payment processor without notice to you. With the exception of tips and the purchase of Posh Cash, cash payments are strictly prohibited unless expressly permitted by Posh. Your payment of Charges to Posh satisfies your payment obligation for your use of the Posh Platform, Posh Services, Third-Party Services, and Rideshare Services. Certain Charges may be collectively billed as a single purchase transaction to your selected payment method based on the payment frequency indicated in your settings. If your primary payment method expires, is invalid, or if Charges to your primary payment method are unable to be processed for whatever reason, then you agree that Posh may charge your other available payment methods in the Posh Platform. If you don't recognize a transaction, then check your ride receipts and payment history.<br>
No Refunds. All Charges are non-refundable except to the extent required by law. This no-refund policy shall apply at all times regardless of your decision to terminate usage of the Posh Platform, any disruption to the Posh Platform, Posh Services, Third-Party Services, or Rideshare Services, or any other reason whatsoever.<br>
Coupons. You may receive coupons, credits, discounts, or other promotions (collectively, &ldquo;Coupons&rdquo;) that you can apply toward payment of certain Charges. Coupons are valid only for use on the Posh Platform, and are not transferable or redeemable for cash except as required by law. Coupons cannot be combined unless expressly provided otherwise, and if the cost of your Charges exceeds the applicable Coupon value, we may charge your payment method on file for the Charges in excess of the Coupon amount. With respect to Fares, Posh may deduct the amount attributable to the Service Fee, Tolls, or Other Charges before application of the Coupon. Additional restrictions on Coupons may apply as communicated to you in a relevant promotion or by clicking on the relevant Coupon within the Rewards section of the Posh Platform.<br>
Supplemental Charges. Charges related to Posh Services (including the rental of bikes and scooters) may be further detailed in the applicable Supplemental Agreement.<br>
Third-Party Charges. If you choose to purchase Third-Party Services (described further in Section 20) through the Posh Platform, you authorize your payment method on file to be charged according to the pricing terms set by Posh or the third-party provider, or as otherwise provided in the terms of the purchased services.<br>
Payment Card Authorization. Upon addition of a new payment method or each request for Posh Services, Rideshare Services, or Third-Party Services, Posh may seek authorization of your selected payment method to verify the payment method, ensure the Charges will be covered, and protect against unauthorized behavior. The authorization is not a charge, however, it may reduce your available credit by the authorization amount until your bank&rsquo;s next processing cycle. Should the amount of our authorization exceed the total funds on deposit in your account, you may be subject to overdraft of NSF charges by the bank issuing your debit or prepaid card. Posh is not responsible for these charges and is unable to assist you in recovering them from your issuing bank. Check out our Help Center to learn more about our use of pre-authorization holds.<br>
For clarity, Posh does not charge a fee for Users to access the Posh Platform, but retains the right to charge Users and/or organizations, if applicable, a fee or any other Charge for accessing or using Posh Services, Rideshare Services, or Third-Party Services made available through the Posh Platform.</p>

If you create any materials (physical or digital) bearing the Posh Marks (in violation of this Agreement or otherwise), you agree that upon their creation Posh exclusively owns all right, title and interest in and to such materials, including any modifications to the Posh Marks or derivative works based on the Posh Marks or Posh copyrights.

It is up to the Driver to decide whether or not to offer a ride to a Rider contacted through the Posh Platform, and it is up to the Rider to decide whether or not to accept a ride from any Driver contacted through the Posh Platform. We cannot ensure that a Driver or Rider will complete an arranged transportation service. We have no control over the quality or safety of the transportation that occurs as a result of the Rideshare Services. Any safety-related feature, process, policy, standard, or other effort undertaken by Posh is not an indication of any employment or agency relationship with any User.</p>

We do not guarantee and do not promise any specific results from use of the Posh Platform, Posh Services, Third-Party Services, and/or the Rideshare Services, including the ability to provide or receive Rideshare Services at any given location or time. Posh reserves the right, for example, to limit or eliminate access to the Posh Platform for Rideshare Services, Third-Party Services, and/or Posh Services in specific geographic areas and/or at specific times based on commercial viability, public health concerns, or changes in law. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we specifically disclaim any implied warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. Some states do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties, so the foregoing disclaimer may not apply to you.</p>

<p>We do not warrant that your use of the Posh Platform, Posh Services, Third-Party Services, or Rideshare Services will be accurate, complete, reliable, current, secure, uninterrupted, always available, or error-free, or will meet your requirements, that any defects in the Posh Platform will be corrected, or that the Posh Platform is free of viruses or other harmful components. We disclaim liability for, and no warranty is made with respect to, connectivity, availability, accuracy, completeness, and reliability of the Posh Platform, Posh Services, Third-Party Services, or Rideshare Services, including with respect to mapping, navigation, estimated times of arrival, and routing services.

<p>Limitation of Liability<br>
IN NO EVENT WILL Posh, INCLUDING OUR AFFILIATES, SUBSIDIARIES, PARENTS, SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS, AND EACH OF OUR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OR SHAREHOLDERS (COLLECTIVELY &ldquo;Posh&rdquo; FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION), BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR DELETION, CORRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF PROGRAMS, FAILURE TO STORE ANY INFORMATION OR OTHER CONTENT MAINTAINED OR TRANSMITTED BY THE Posh PLATFORM, SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS, OR FOR THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES) ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE Posh PLATFORM, Posh SERVICES, THE RIDESHARE SERVICES, OR THIS AGREEMENT, HOWEVER ARISING INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, EVEN IF WE OR OUR AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES KNOW OR HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

This Agreement is effective upon your acceptance of this Agreement. This Agreement may be terminated: (a) by User, without cause, upon seven (7) days&rsquo; prior written notice to Posh; or (b) by either Party immediately, without notice, upon the other Party&rsquo;s material breach of this Agreement, including but not limited to any breach of Section 9 or breach of Section 10(a)-(i) of this Agreement.

For all other breaches of this Agreement, you will be provided notice and an opportunity to cure the breach. If the breach is cured in a timely manner and to Posh&rsquo;s satisfaction, this Agreement will not be permanently terminated.

<p>DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION AGREEMENT<br>
(a) Agreement to Binding Arbitration Between You and Posh.<br>
YOU AND Posh MUTUALLY AGREE TO WAIVE OUR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES IN A COURT OF LAW BY A JUDGE OR JURY AND AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BY ARBITRATION, as set forth below. This agreement to arbitrate (&ldquo;Arbitration Agreement&rdquo;) is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (&ldquo;FAA&rdquo;); but if the FAA is inapplicable for any reason, then this Arbitration Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, including Del. Code tit. 10, &sect; 5701 et seq., without regard to choice of law principles. This Arbitration Agreement survives after the Agreement terminates or your relationship with Posh ends. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. Except as expressly provided below, this Arbitration Agreement applies to all Claims (defined below) between you and Posh, including our affiliates, subsidiaries, parents, successors and assigns, and each of our respective officers, directors, employees, agents, or shareholders. This Arbitration Agreement also applies to claims between you and Posh&rsquo;s service providers, including but not limited to background check providers and payment processors; and such service providers shall be considered intended third-party beneficiaries of this Arbitration Agreement.</p>

<p>Except as expressly provided below, ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS BETWEEN US (EACH A &ldquo;CLAIM&rdquo; AND COLLECTIVELY, &ldquo;CLAIMS&rdquo;) SHALL BE EXCLUSIVELY RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION SOLELY BETWEEN YOU AND Posh. These Claims include, but are not limited to, any dispute, claim or controversy, whether based on past, present, or future events, arising out of or relating to: this Agreement and prior versions thereof (including the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof), the Posh Platform, the Rideshare Services, the Posh Services, Posh promotions, gift card, referrals or loyalty programs, the Posh Tablet, any other goods or services made available through the Posh Platform by Posh or a third-party provider, your relationship with Posh, the threatened or actual suspension, deactivation or termination of your User Account or this Agreement, background checks performed by or on Posh&rsquo;s behalf, payments made by you or any payments made or allegedly owed to you, any promotions or offers made by Posh, any city, county, state or federal wage-hour law, trade secrets, unfair competition, compensation, breaks and rest periods, expense reimbursement, wrongful termination, discrimination, harassment, retaliation, fraud, defamation, emotional distress, breach of any express or implied contract or covenant, claims arising under federal or state consumer protection laws; claims arising under antitrust laws, claims arising under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act; and claims arising under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, Civil Rights Act of 1964, Americans With Disabilities Act, Age Discrimination in Employment Act, Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, Family Medical Leave Act, Fair Labor Standards Act, Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (except for individual claims for employee benefits under any benefit plan sponsored by Posh and covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or funded by insurance), and state statutes, if any, addressing the same or similar subject matters, and all other federal and state statutory and common law claims. All disputes concerning the arbitrability of a Claim (including disputes about the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of the Arbitration Agreement) shall be decided by the arbitrator, except as expressly provided below.</p>

<p>BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND Posh ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL FOR ALL CLAIMS, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. This Arbitration Agreement is intended to require arbitration of every claim or dispute that can lawfully be arbitrated, except for those claims and disputes which by the terms of this Arbitration Agreement are expressly excluded from the requirement to arbitrate.</p>

<p>(b) Prohibition of Class Actions and Non-Individualized Relief.<br>
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU AND Posh MAY EACH BRING CLAIMS IN ARBITRATION AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE ACTION, OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS (&ldquo;CLASS ACTION WAIVER&rdquo;). YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU AND Posh BOTH ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PURSUE OR HAVE A DISPUTE RESOLVED AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THIS SUBSECTION (B) SHALL NOT APPLY TO REPRESENTATIVE PRIVATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL ACT CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST Posh, WHICH ARE ADDRESSED SEPARATELY IN SECTION 17(C).</p>

<p>The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any Claim or issue any relief on any basis other than an individual basis. The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any Claim or issue any relief on a class, collective, or representative basis. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claims.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or the AAA Rules, disputes regarding the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of the Class Action Waiver may be resolved only by a court and not by an arbitrator. In any case in which: (1) the dispute is filed as a class, collective, or representative action and (2) there is a final judicial determination that the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable with respect to any Claim or any particular remedy for a Claim (such as a request for public injunctive relief), then that Claim or particular remedy (and only that Claim or particular remedy) shall be severed from any remaining claims and/or remedies and may be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, but the Class Action Waiver shall be enforced in arbitration on an individual basis as to all other Claims or remedies to the fullest extent possible.</p>

<p>(c) Representative PAGA Waiver.<br>
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Arbitration Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by law: (1) you and Posh agree not to bring a representative action on behalf of others under the Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 (&ldquo;PAGA&rdquo;), California Labor Code &sect; 2698 et seq., in any court or in arbitration, and (2) for any claim brought on a private attorney general basis, including under the California PAGA, both you and Posh agree that any such dispute shall be resolved in arbitration on an individual basis only (i.e., to resolve whether you have personally been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law), and that such an action may not be used to resolve the claims or rights of other individuals in a single or collective proceeding (i.e., to resolve whether other individuals have been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law) (collectively, &ldquo;representative PAGA Waiver&rdquo;). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or the AAA Rules, disputes regarding the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of this representative PAGA Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. If any provision of this representative PAGA Waiver is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason: (i) the unenforceable provision shall be severed from this Agreement; (ii) severance of the unenforceable provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the Arbitration Agreement or the requirement that any remaining Claims be arbitrated on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement; and (iii) any such representative PAGA or other representative private attorneys general act claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. To the extent that there are any Claims to be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction because a civil court of competent jurisdiction determines that the representative PAGA Waiver is unenforceable with respect to those Claims, the Parties agree that litigation of those Claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual Claims in arbitration.</p>

<p>(d) Rules Governing the Arbitration.<br>
Any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;) pursuant to its Consumer Arbitration Rules that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated, as modified by the terms set forth in this Agreement. Copies of these rules can be obtained at the AAA&rsquo;s website (www.adr.org) (the &ldquo;AAA Rules&rdquo;). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if requested by you and if proper based on the facts and circumstances of the Claims presented, the arbitrator shall have the discretion to select a different set of AAA Rules, but in no event shall the arbitrator consolidate more than one person&rsquo;s Claims, or otherwise preside over any form of representative, collective, or class proceeding. The parties may select a different arbitration administrator upon mutual written agreement.</p>

<p>As part of the arbitration, both you and Posh will have the opportunity for reasonable discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim. The arbitrator may award any individualized remedies that would be available in court. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claims. The arbitrator will provide a reasoned written statement of the arbitrator&rsquo;s decision which shall explain the award given and the findings and conclusions on which the decision is based.</p>

<p>The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different Riders or Drivers, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same Rider or Driver to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator&rsquo;s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof, provided that any award may be challenged in a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

<p>(e) Arbitration Fees and Awards.<br>
The payment of filing and arbitration fees will be governed by the relevant AAA Rules subject to the following modifications:</p>

<p>If Posh initiates arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, Posh will pay all AAA filing and arbitration fees.<br>
With respect to any Claims brought by Posh against a Driver, or for Claims brought by a Driver against Posh that: (A) are based on an alleged employment relationship between Posh and a Driver; (B) arise out of, or relate to, Posh&rsquo;s actual deactivation of a Driver&rsquo;s User account or a threat by Posh to deactivate a Driver&rsquo;s User account; (C) arise out of, or relate to, Posh&rsquo;s actual termination of a Driver&rsquo;s Agreement with Posh under the termination provisions of this Agreement, or a threat by Posh to terminate a Driver&rsquo;s Agreement; (D) arise out of, or relate to, Fares (as defined in this Agreement, including Posh&rsquo;s commission or fees on the Fares), tips, or average hourly guarantees owed by Posh to Drivers for Rideshare Services, other than disputes relating to referral bonuses, other Posh promotions, or consumer-type disputes, or (E) arise out of or relate to background checks performed in connection with a user seeking to become a Driver (the subset of Claims in subsections (A)-(E) shall be collectively referred to as &ldquo;Driver Claims&rdquo;), Posh shall pay all costs unique to arbitration (as compared to the costs of adjudicating the same claims before a court), including the regular and customary arbitration fees and expenses (to the extent not paid by Posh pursuant to the fee provisions above). However, if you are the party initiating the Driver Claim, you shall be responsible for contributing up to an amount equal to the filing fee that would be paid to initiate the claim in the court of general jurisdiction in the state in which you provide Rideshare Services to Riders, unless a lower fee amount would be owed by you pursuant to the AAA Rules, applicable law, or subsection (e)(1) above. Any dispute as to whether a cost is unique to arbitration shall be resolved by the arbitrator. For purposes of this Section 17(e)(2), the term &ldquo;Driver&rdquo; shall be deemed to include both Drivers and Driver applicants who have not been approved to drive.<br>
Except as provided in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 or any state equivalents, each party shall pay its own attorneys&rsquo; fees and pay any costs that are not unique to the arbitration (i.e., costs that each party would incur if the claim(s) were litigated in a court such as costs to subpoena witnesses and/or documents, take depositions and purchase deposition transcripts, copy documents, etc.).<br>
At the end of any arbitration, the arbitrator may award reasonable fees and costs or any portion thereof to you if you prevail, to the extent authorized by applicable law.<br>
Although under some laws Posh may have a right to an award of attorneys' fees and non-filing fee expenses if it prevails in an arbitration, Posh agrees that it will not seek such an award unless you are represented by an attorney or the arbitrator has determined that the claim is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).<br>
If the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Posh&rsquo;s last written settlement offer made after you participated in good faith in the optional Negotiation process described in subsection (k) below, then Posh will pay you the amount of the award or U.S. $1,000, whichever is greater.<br>
(f) Location and Manner of Arbitration.<br>
Unless you and Posh agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings between Posh and a Rider will take place in the county of your billing address, and any arbitration hearings between Posh and a Driver will take place in the county in which the Driver provides Rideshare Services. If AAA arbitration is unavailable in your county, the arbitration hearings will take place in the nearest available location for a AAA arbitration. Your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.</p>

<p>(g) Exceptions to Arbitration.<br>
This Arbitration Agreement shall not require arbitration of the following types of claims: (1) small claims actions brought on an individual basis that are within the scope of such small claims court&rsquo;s jurisdiction; (2) a representative action brought on behalf of others under PAGA or other private attorneys general acts, to the extent the representative PAGA Waiver in Section 17(c) of such action is deemed unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction under applicable law not preempted by the FAA; (3) claims for workers&rsquo; compensation, state disability insurance and unemployment insurance benefits; (4) claims that may not be subject to arbitration as a matter of generally applicable law not preempted by the FAA; and (5) individual claims of sexual assault or sexual harassment in connection with the use of the Posh Platform, Posh Services, or Rideshare Services. Where these claims are brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, Posh will not require arbitration of those claims. Posh&rsquo;s agreement not to require arbitration of these claims does not waive the enforceability of any other provision of this Arbitration Agreement (including without limitation the waivers provided in Section 17(b)), or of the enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement as to any other dispute, claim, or controversy.</p>

<p>Nothing in this Arbitration Agreement prevents you from making a report to or filing a claim or charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, U.S. Department of Labor, Securities Exchange Commission, National Labor Relations Board (&ldquo;NLRB&rdquo;), or Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, or similar local, state or federal agency, and nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall be deemed to preclude or excuse a party from bringing an administrative claim before any agency in order to fulfill the party's obligation to exhaust administrative remedies before making a claim in arbitration However, should you bring an administrative claim, you may only seek or recover money damages of any type pursuant to this Arbitration Provision, and you knowingly and voluntarily waive the right to seek or recover money damages of any type pursuant to any administrative complaint, except for a complaint issued by the NLRB. Should you participate in an NLRB proceeding, you may only recover money damages if such recovery does not arise from or relate to a claim previously adjudicated under this Arbitration Provision or settled by you. Similarly, you may not recover money damages under this Arbitration Provision if you have already adjudicated such claim with the NLRB. Nothing in this Agreement or Arbitration Agreement prevents your participation in an investigation by a government agency of any report, claim or charge otherwise covered by this Arbitration Provision.</p>

<p>(h) Severability.<br>
Except as otherwise provided in the severability provisions in subsections (b) and (c) above, in the event that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed illegal or unenforceable under applicable law not preempted by the FAA, such provision shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall be given full force and effect.</p>

<p>(i) Driver Claims in Pending Settlement.<br>
If you are a member of a putative class in a lawsuit against Posh involving Driver Claims and a Motion for Preliminary Approval of a Settlement has been filed with the court in that lawsuit prior to this Agreement&rsquo;s effective date (a &ldquo;Pending Settlement Action&rdquo;), then this Arbitration Agreement shall not apply to your Driver Claims in that particular class action. Instead, your Driver Claims in that Pending Settlement Action shall continue to be governed by the arbitration provisions contained in the applicable Agreement that you accepted prior to this Agreement&rsquo;s effective date.</p>

<p>(j) Opting Out of Arbitration for Driver Claims That Are Not In a Pending Settlement Action.<br>
As a Driver or Driver applicant, you may opt out of the requirement to arbitrate Driver Claims defined in Section 17(e)(2) (except as limited by Section 17(i) above) pursuant to the terms of this subsection if you have not previously agreed to an arbitration provision in Posh&rsquo;s Terms of Service where you had the opportunity to opt out of the requirement to arbitrate. If you have previously agreed to such an arbitration provision, you may opt out of any revisions to your prior arbitration agreement made by this provision in the manner specified below, but opting out of this arbitration provision has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with Posh. If you have not previously agreed to such an arbitration provision and do not wish to be subject to this Arbitration Agreement with respect to Driver Claims, you may opt out of arbitration with respect to such Driver Claims, other than those in a Pending Settlement Action, by notifying Posh in writing of your desire to opt out of arbitration for such Driver Claims, which writing must be dated, signed and delivered by electronic mail to arbitrationoptout@Posh.com.</p>

<p>In order to be effective, (A) the writing must clearly indicate your intent to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement with respect to Driver Claims that are not part of a Pending Settlement Action, (B) the writing must include the name, phone number, and email address associated with your User Account, and (C) the email containing the signed writing must be sent within 30 days after the date this Agreement is executed by you. Should you not opt out within the 30-day period, you and Posh shall be bound by the terms of this Arbitration Agreement in full (including with respect to Driver Claims that are not part of a Pending Settlement Action). As provided in paragraph 17(i) above, any opt out that you submit shall not apply to any Driver Claims that are part of a Pending Settlement Action and your Driver Claims in any such Pending Settlement Action shall continue to be governed by the arbitration provisions that are contained in the applicable Posh Terms of Use that you agreed to prior to the effective date of this Agreement.</p>

<p>Cases have been filed against Posh and may be filed in the future involving Driver Claims. You should assume that there are now, and may be in the future, lawsuits against Posh alleging class, collective, and/or representative Driver Claims in which the plaintiffs seek to act on your behalf, and which, if successful, could result in some monetary recovery to you. But if you do agree to arbitration of Driver Claims with Posh under this Arbitration Agreement, you are agreeing in advance that you will bring all such claims, and seek all monetary and other relief, against Posh in an individual arbitration, except for the Driver Claims that are part of a Pending Settlement Action. You are also agreeing in advance that you will not participate in, or seek to recover monetary or other relief, for such claims in any court action or class, collective, and/or representative action. You have the right to consult with counsel of your choice concerning this Arbitration Agreement and you will not be subject to retaliation if you exercise your right to assert claims or opt- out of any Driver Claims under this Arbitration Agreement.</p>

<p>(k) Optional Pre-Arbitration Negotiation Process.<br>
Before initiating any arbitration or proceeding, you and Posh may agree to first attempt to negotiate any dispute, claim or controversy between the parties informally for 30 days, unless this time period is mutually extended by you and Posh. A party who intends to seek negotiation under this subsection must first send to the other a written notice of the dispute (&ldquo;Notice&rdquo;). The Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2) set forth the specific relief sought. All offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the negotiation by any of the parties, their agents, employees, and attorneys are confidential, privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, including as evidence of liability or for impeachment, in arbitration or other proceeding involving the parties, provided that evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or as this could violate HIPAA non-discoverable as a result of its use in the negotiation.</p>

<p>(l) Binding Effect; Third-Party Beneficiaries.<br>
This Arbitration Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall include any claims brought by or against any third parties, including but not limited to your spouses, heirs, third-party beneficiaries and permitted assigns, where their underlying claim(s) arise out of or relate to your use of the Posh Platform, Posh Services, or Rideshare Services. To the extent that any third-party beneficiary to this Agreement brings claims against a party, those claims shall also be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.</p>

You shall not disclose or permit disclosure of any Confidential Information to third parties, and you agree not to store separate and outside of the Posh Platform any Confidential Information obtained from the Posh Platform. As a Driver, you understand that some of the Confidential Information you receive may be protected by federal and/or state confidentiality laws, such as the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (&ldquo;HIPAA&rdquo;), governing the privacy and security of protected (patient) health information. In the event that you know a Rider, you should not disclose to anyone the identity of the Rider or the location that you picked up, or dropped off the Rider, as this could violate HIPAA. You understand that any violation of the Agreement&rsquo;s confidentiality provisions may violate HIPAA or state confidentiality laws and could result in civil or criminal penalties against you. You agree to take all reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure or use of Confidential Information of Posh in order to prevent it from falling into the public domain. Notwithstanding the above, you shall not have liability to Posh with regard to any Confidential Information which you can prove: was in the public domain at the time it was disclosed by Posh or has entered the public domain through no fault of yours; was known to you, without restriction, at the time of disclosure, as demonstrated by files in existence at the time of disclosure; is disclosed with the prior written approval of Posh; becomes known to you, without restriction, from a source other than Posh without breach of this Agreement by you and otherwise not in violation of Posh&rsquo;s rights; or is disclosed pursuant to the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other governmental body; provided, however, that You shall provide prompt notice of such court order or requirement to Posh to enable Posh to seek a protective order or otherwise prevent or restrict such disclosure.</p>

<p>Relationship with Posh<br>
As a Driver on the Posh Platform, you acknowledge and agree that you and Posh are in a direct business relationship, and the relationship between the parties under this Agreement is solely that of independent contracting parties. You and Posh expressly agree that (1) this is not an employment agreement and does not create an employment relationship between you and Posh; and (2) no joint venture, franchisor- franchisee, partnership, or agency relationship is intended or created by this Agreement. You have no authority to bind Posh, and you undertake not to hold yourself out as an employee, agent or authorized representative of Posh.</p>

<p>Posh does not, and shall not be deemed to, direct or control you generally or in your performance under this Agreement specifically, including in connection with your provision of Rideshare Services, your acts or omissions, or your operation and maintenance of your vehicle. You retain the sole right to determine when, where, and for how long you will utilize the Posh Platform. Posh does not, and shall not be deemed to, unilaterally prescribe specific dates, times of day, or any minimum number of hours for you to utilize the Posh Platform. You retain the option to accept or to decline or ignore a Rider&rsquo;s request for Rideshare Services via the Posh Platform, or to cancel an accepted request for Rideshare Services via the Posh Platform, subject to Posh&rsquo;s then-current cancellation policies. Posh does not, and shall not be deemed to, require you to accept any specific request for Rideshare Services as a condition of maintaining access to the platform. With the exception of any signage required by law or permit/license rules or requirements, Posh shall have no right to require you to: (a) display Posh&rsquo;s names, logos or colors on your vehicle(s); or (b) wear a uniform or any other clothing displaying Posh&rsquo;s names, logos or colors. You acknowledge and agree that you have complete discretion to provide Rideshare Services or otherwise engage in any other business or employment activities, including but not limited to providing services similar to the Rideshare Services to other companies, and that Posh does not, and shall not be deemed to, restrict you from engaging in any such activity.</p>

<p>Third-Party Services<br>
In addition to connecting Riders with Drivers, the Posh Platform may enable Users to provide services or receive services from other third parties. For example, Users may be able to use the Posh Platform to plan and reserve rides on public transportation, take a ride in an autonomous vehicle provided by a third party, rent vehicles, bikes, scooters, or other similar personal transportation devices provided by a third party, receive roadside assistance, or obtain financial, vehicle repair, insurance, or other services provided by third parties (collectively, the &ldquo;Third-Party Services&rdquo;). This Agreement between you and Posh governs your use of the Posh Platform in connection with the Third-Party Services.</p>

<p>In addition, you understand that the Third-Party Services may also be subject to terms and pricing of the third-party provider (collectively, the &ldquo;Third-Party Terms&rdquo;) which will govern your relationship with such third-party provider, as applicable. You agree that Posh is not responsible and may not be held liable for the Third-Party Services or the actions or omissions of the third-party provider. Such Third-Party Services may not be investigated, monitored or checked for accuracy, appropriateness, or completeness by Posh, and Posh is not responsible for any Third-Party Services accessed through the Posh Platform. This Agreement incorporates by reference ADT Mobile Security Monitoring Terms, which are Third-Party Terms.</p>

<p>In the event of a conflict in the terms of any Third-Party Terms and this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control with respect to Posh and your agreements with Posh herein, and the limitations of liability set forth in Section 15 above shall also apply to the third-party provider. The Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement provisions in Section 17 above shall apply instead of any terms in any Third-Party Terms for all purposes except with respect to claims that are solely against the third-party provider.</p>

<p>General<br>
Except as provided in Section 17, this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to choice of law principles. This choice of law provision is only intended to specify the use of California law to interpret this Agreement and is not intended to create any other substantive right to non-Californians to assert claims under California law whether by statute, common law, or otherwise. If any provision of this Agreement is or becomes invalid or non-binding, the parties shall remain bound by all other provisions of this Agreement. In that event, the parties shall replace the invalid or non-binding provision with provisions that are valid and binding and that have, to the greatest extent possible, a similar effect as the invalid or non-binding provision, given the contents and purpose of this Agreement. You agree that this Agreement and all incorporated agreements may be automatically assigned by Posh, in our sole discretion by providing notice to you. You may not assign this Agreement without Posh&rsquo;s prior written approval. Any purported assignment by you in violation of this Section 21 shall be void. Except as explicitly stated otherwise, any notices to Posh shall be given by certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested to Posh, Inc., 548 Market Street, #68514 San Francisco, CA 94104. Any notices to you shall be provided to you through the Posh Platform or given to you via the email address or physical address you provide to Posh during the registration process. Headings are for reference purposes only and in no way define, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of such section. The words &ldquo;include&rdquo;, &ldquo;includes&rdquo; and &ldquo;including&rdquo; are deemed to be followed by the words &ldquo;without limitation&rdquo;. A party&rsquo;s failure to act with respect to a breach by the other party does not constitute a waiver of the party&rsquo;s right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches, any such waiver shall be in writing. This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding and agreement between you and Posh with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all previous understandings and agreements between the parties, whether oral or written.</p>

<p>Posh Privacy Policy<br>
Last Updated: May 10, 2024</p>

<p>At Posh our mission is to improve people&rsquo;s lives with the world&rsquo;s best transportation, providing a platform to help you get from point A to point B and enjoy the ride. To do that, we need to collect, use, and share some of your personal information. This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand how Posh does that and how to exercise the choices and rights you have in your information.</p>

<p>Posh&rsquo;s privacy homepage provides additional information about our commitment to respecting your personal information, including ways for you to access and delete that information.</p>

<p>The Scope of This Policy<br>
This policy applies to all Posh users, including Riders and Drivers (including Driver applicants), and to all Posh platforms and services, including our applications, websites, technology, facilities, and other services (collectively, the &ldquo;Posh Platform&rdquo;). This policy applies only to personal information, not to aggregate information or information that does not identify you. Please remember that your use of the Posh Platform is also subject to our Terms of Service. Certain elements of the Posh Platform may operate under separate or additional terms or practices different from or in addition to those described in this policy; in those cases, you will be provided separate notice and information relevant to your use of those parts of the Posh Platform.</p>

<p>For users in California, Canada, Colorado, Connecticut, Montana, Oregon, Texas, Utah, and Virginia: Additional information regarding Posh&rsquo;s privacy practices under location-specific privacy laws is available here.</p>

<p>The Information We Collect<br>
When you use the Posh Platform, we collect the information you provide, usage information, and information about your device. We also collect information about you from other sources like service providers, and optional programs in which you participate, which we may combine with other information we have about you. Here are the types of information we collect about you:</p>

<p>A. Information You Provide to Us<br>
Account Registration. When you create an account with Posh, we collect the information you provide us, such as your name, email address, phone number, birth date, profile photo, and payment information. You may choose to share additional info with us for your Rider profile, like saved addresses (e.g., home or work), and set up other preferences (such as your preferred pronouns). We may ask that you provide additional information related to the identity of your account, such as documents related to identification (e.g., driver&rsquo;s license), a profile picture, or &ldquo;selfie&rdquo; imagery. If you choose to engage in additional offerings on the Posh Platform (e.g., services for your vehicle or linking to other accounts like travel rewards), you may provide us additional information relevant to those offerings.</p>

<p>Driver Information. If you apply to be a Driver, we will collect the information you provide in your application, including your name, email address, phone number, birth date, profile photo, physical address, government identification number (such as social security number), driver&rsquo;s license information, vehicle information, and car insurance information. We collect the payment information you provide us, including your bank routing numbers and tax information. Depending on where you want to drive, we may also ask for additional business license or permit information or other information to manage driving and programs relevant to that location. We may need additional information from you at some point after you become a Driver, including information to confirm your identity (like &ldquo;selfie&rdquo; imagery).</p>

<p>Ratings and Feedback. When you rate and provide feedback about the Posh Platform (including about Riders or Drivers), we collect all of the information you provide in your feedback.</p>

<p>Communications. When you contact us or we contact you, including through surveys or research projects, we collect any information that you provide, including the contents of the messages or attachments you send us.</p>

<p>B. Information We Collect When You Use the Posh Platform<br>
Location Information. Great rides start with an easy and accurate pickup. The Posh Platform collects location information (including GPS and WiFi data, IP address, and Bluetooth data) differently depending on your Posh app settings and device permissions as well as whether you are using the platform as a Rider or Driver:</p>

<p>Riders: We collect your device&rsquo;s precise location when you open and use the Posh app, including while the app is running in the background from the time you request a ride until it ends. Posh also tracks the precise location of scooters and e-bikes at all times.<br>
Drivers: We collect your device&rsquo;s precise location when you open and use the app, including while the app is running in the background. We also collect precise location for a limited time after you exit driver mode in order to detect ride incidents, and continue collecting it until a reported or detected incident is no longer active. If you choose to install a Posh Platform device in or on your vehicle (e.g., a Posh dashboard device or tablet), that device may collect precise location information when turned on.<br>
Usage Information. We collect information about your use of the Posh Platform, including ride information like the date, time, destination, distance, route, payment, and whether you used a promotional or referral code. Our e-bikes and scooters may collect mobile sensor data, such as speed, direction, height, acceleration, deceleration, and other technical data. We also collect information about your interactions with the Posh Platform like our apps and websites, including the pages and content you view and the dates and times of your use.</p>

<p>Device Information. We collect information about the devices you use to access the Posh Platform, including device model, IP address, type of browser, version of operating system, identity of carrier and manufacturer, radio type (such as 4G), preferences and settings (such as preferred language), application installations, device identifiers, advertising identifiers, and push notification tokens. If you are a Driver, we also collect mobile sensor data from your device (such as speed, direction, height, acceleration, deceleration, and other technical data). If you have installed a Posh Platform device in your vehicle (e.g., a Posh dashboard device or tablet), that device may similarly collect sensor data and other information like location, as described when you choose and set up such devices.</p>

<p>Communications Between Riders and Drivers. We work with a third party to facilitate phone calls and text messages between Riders and Drivers without sharing either party&rsquo;s actual phone number with the other. But while we use a third party to provide the communication service, we collect information about these communications and Posh Platform chat communications, including the participants&rsquo; phone numbers, the date and time, and the contents of SMS and chat messages. For security purposes, we may also monitor or record the contents of phone calls made through the Posh Platform, but we will always let you know we are about to do so before the call begins.</p>

<p>Address Book Contacts. You may set your device permissions to grant Posh access to your contact lists and direct Posh to access your contact list, for example to help you refer friends to Posh. If you choose to do this, we will access the names and contact information of the people in your address book.</p>

<p>Calendar Information. You may set your device permissions or otherwise grant Posh access to your chosen calendar and direct Posh to access calendar information, for example to help you get alerts to order a ride for your upcoming trip. If you choose to do this, we will access and store information available in your calendar to use in providing you these optional features. Posh will adhere to the applicable calendar provider policies, including Google&rsquo;s API Services User Data Policy, which impose certain limitations on the use of data collected from user&rsquo;s calendar accounts. You may remove Posh&rsquo;s access to your accounts at any time either in-app or through your account provider settings.</p>

<p>Cookies, Analytics, and Third-Party Technologies. We collect information through the use of &ldquo;cookies&rdquo;, tracking pixels, data analytics tools like Google Analytics, SDKs, and other third-party technologies to understand how you navigate through the Posh Platform and interact with advertisements, to make your Posh experience safer, to learn what content is popular, to improve your site experience, to serve you better ads on other sites, and to save your preferences. Cookies are small text files that web servers place on your device; they are designed to store basic information and to help websites and apps recognize your browser. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be accessed every time you use the Posh Platform.</p>

<p>Inferences. We may infer certain information from your interactions with the Posh Platform and other personal information available to us. For example, if you frequently ride to or from airports, we may infer you are a frequent traveler. We may also draw inferences from the information you provide to us, such as inferring your gender based on your first name.</p>

<p>C. Information We Collect From Other Sources<br>
Service Providers and Other Parties. Service providers and other parties provide us with information needed for core aspects of the Posh Platform, as well as for additional services, programs, loyalty benefits, and promotions that can enhance your Posh experience.

<p>How We Disclose Your Information<br>
We do not sell your personal information to third parties for money -- no one can buy the personal information we collect from and about you and we do not act as a data broker. However, we may need to share your personal information with third parties to deliver relevant personalized ads to you on and off the Posh Platform. Some of these disclosures may constitute &ldquo;sharing&rdquo; or the &ldquo;sale&rdquo; of personal information for &ldquo;targeted advertising&rdquo; purposes under certain local (e.g., U.S. state) privacy laws, which we describe in more detail here. This section otherwise explains when, why, and with whom we disclose your information.</p>

<p>A. Sharing Between Posh Users<br>
Riders and Drivers.</p>

<p>Rider information shared with Driver: As part of surfacing the ride request and enabling the ride, we share with the Driver the Rider&rsquo;s pickup and destination, location, name, profile photo, rating, Rider statistics (like approximate number of rides and years as a Rider), and information the Rider includes in their Rider profile (like preferred pronouns) as well as any additional stops the Rider inputs into the Posh app. Once the ride is finished, we also eventually share the Rider&rsquo;s rating and feedback with the Driver. (We remove the Rider&rsquo;s identity associated with ratings and feedback when we share it with Drivers, but a Driver may be able to identify the Rider that provided the rating or feedback.)</p>

<p>Driver information shared with Rider: Upon a Driver accepting a requested ride, we will share with the Rider the Driver&rsquo;s name, profile photo, preferred pronouns, rating, real-time location, and the vehicle make, model, color, and license plate, as well as other information in the Driver&rsquo;s Posh profile, such as information Drivers choose to add (like country flag and why you drive) and Driver statistics (like approximate number of rides and years as a Driver).</p>

<p>Although we help Riders and Drivers communicate with one another to arrange a pickup, we do not share your actual phone number or other contact information with other users when enabling this. If you report a lost or found item to us, we will seek to connect you with the relevant Rider or Driver, which may include sharing actual contact information with your consent.</p>

<p>Shared Ride Riders. When Riders use a Posh Shared ride, we share each Rider&rsquo;s name and profile picture to ensure safety. Riders may also see each other&rsquo;s pickup and drop-off locations as part of knowing the route while sharing the ride.</p>

<p>Rides Requested or Paid For by Others. Some rides you take may be requested or paid for by others. If you take one of those rides using your Posh Business Profile account; a pass, code or coupon; a subsidized program (e.g., transit or government); a corporate credit card linked to another account; or another user or entity otherwise requests or pays for a ride (or portion of a ride) for you, we may share some or all of your ride details with that other party, including your identity (e.g., name, phone number), the date, time, charge, rating given, region of trip, and pick up and drop off location of your ride.</p>

<p>Linked Accounts and Sharing Upon Your Request. If you use the Posh Platform as part of a Posh Family account linked with others or if you direct us to share your information with trusted contacts, we will then share with those parties information about your use of the Posh Platform, such as the live location of your ride.</p>

<p>Referral Programs. If you refer someone to the Posh Platform, we will let them know that you generated the referral. If another user referred you, we may share information about your use of the Posh Platform with that user. For example, a referral source may receive a bonus when you join the Posh Platform or complete a certain number of rides and would receive such information.</p>

<p>B. Disclosures to Service Providers to Provide the Posh Platform, and Other Parties<br>
Depending on whether you&rsquo;re a Rider or a Driver, Posh may disclose the following categories of your personal information to provide you with a variety of the Posh Platform&rsquo;s features and services:</p>

Financial information, such as bank routing numbers, tax information, and any other payment information you provide us;<br>
Commercial information, such as ride information, Driver/Rider statistics and feedback, and Driver/Rider transaction history;<br>
Internet or other electronic network activity information, such as your IP address, type of browser, version of operating system, carrier and/or manufacturer, device identifiers, and mobile and other forms of advertising identifiers;<br>
Location data; and<br>
This and other information you may direct us to disclose to other parties, such as when you choose to link your Posh account with a separate travel rewards program or when you choose to engage with an offering from another company through the Posh Platform, such as a vehicle service.<br>
We disclose those categories of personal information to these other parties and service providers to fulfill the following purposes:</p>

<p>Maintaining and servicing your Posh account;<br>
Processing or fulfilling rides or other offerings of the Posh Platform;<br>
Providing you customer service;<br>

C. For Legal Reasons and to Protect the Posh Platform<br>
We may disclose your personal information in response to a legal obligation, or if we have determined that disclosing your personal information is reasonably necessary or appropriate to:</p>

<p>How We Store and Protect Your Information<br>
We retain your information for as long as necessary to provide you and our other users the Posh Platform. This means we keep your profile information for as long as you maintain an account. We retain transactional information such as rides and payments for at least seven years to ensure we can perform legitimate business functions, such as accounting for tax obligations. We also retain your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our terms and policies. If you request account deletion, we will delete your information as set forth in the &ldquo;Deleting Your Account&rdquo; section below.</p>

<p>We take reasonable and appropriate measures designed to protect your personal information. But no security measures can be 100% effective, and we cannot guarantee the security of your information, including against unauthorized intrusions or acts by third parties.</p>

When we delete your account, we may retain certain information for legitimate business purposes or to comply with legal or regulatory obligations. For example, we may retain your information to resolve open insurance claims, or we may be obligated to retain your information as part of an open legal claim. When we retain such data, we do so in ways designed to prevent its use for other purposes.</p>
